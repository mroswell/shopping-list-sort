  See how it works with a sample recipe such as: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/186378/sweet-potato-carrot-apple-and-red-lentil-soup/

**Website Specs**
- Paste a shopping list into an input box.
- Generate a new web page that includes Recipes JSON-LD (and any other resources needed to enable it to work with the Instacart plugin)
https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/recipe
- Test the site to ensure that it will automatically add the list to an Instacart shopping cart
- Maybe add capacity to save the list for future use.
