Under development:

HI, would you like to take on a little project? In essence, I want something like this: https://www.textfixer.com/tools/alphabetical-order.php  I want the two text inputs to be side-by-side. The input on the left  takes a long list of groceries, and the output on the right sorts by food category, with the option to either have the category be listed above the foods in each category, or to create a Pipe-delimited list with the category preceding each ingredient.
